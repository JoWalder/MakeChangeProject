# Make Change Project
## Week 1 homework for Skill Distillery
This is my first graded project
### Goals
The goal was to create a program that accepted user input for price of an item.  Then it asked how much was tendered for the item.  Finally, the program was able to calculate how much change would be given back to the customer, and how much of each denomination would be giving back.
### What I Learned
I learned to use the modulus, Math.round and how to effectively use if statements.   I I also had to manipulate variables in many different ways. I learned how to make a cash register.
